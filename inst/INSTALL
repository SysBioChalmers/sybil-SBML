GNU R package sybilSBML: Link to libSBML for sybil


The installation procedure for the sybilSBML package needs to know where to
find the libSBML include directory and where to find the callable library.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Linux and MacOS X installation
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

There are basically four different ways of installing the sybilSBML package:

1) Use --with-sbml-<ARG>

   --with-sbml-include=PATH     with PATH being the include directory of libSBML

   --with-sbml-lib=PATH         with PATH being the directory containing the
                                callable library.

   R CMD INSTALL --configure-args=" \
       --with-sbml-include=/path/to/include/dir \
       --with-sbml-lib=/path/to/lib/dir" sybilSBML_X.X.X.tar.gz


   When using --with-sbml-<ARG>, both arguments must be given.

2) Use of environment variables

   PKG_CPPFLAGS                giving the PATH to the include directory of libSBML
   PKG_LIBS                    giving the PATH to the directory containing the
                               callable library and the libraries to link to.

3) Use --prefix

   --prefix=PATH               with path being the installation directory of
                               sybilSBML. The include directory is assumed to be
                               PATH/include and the callable library should be
                               in PATH/lib.

   If either --with-sbml-<ARG> nor --prefix is given, it is checked wether
   libSBML is located in /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib[64] and
   /usr/include and /usr/lib[64].


4) Use pkg-config

   If pkg-config is available on your system, the pkg-config information
   of libSBML will be used.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Windows installation
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

For the installation on Windows systems the file Makewars.win in src/ is
required. The file looks like this:

PKG_CPPFLAGS= -D_R_=1 -DUSE_R=1 -I"$(LIB_SBML)/include"

PKG_LIBS = -L"$(LIB_SBML)/bin" -lsbml

all: $(SHLIB)
	mkdir -p "$(R_PACKAGE_DIR)/libs$(R_ARCH)"
	cp "$(LIB_SBML)/bin/libsbml.dll" "$(R_PACKAGE_DIR)\libs$(R_ARCH)"

with the environment variable LIB_SBML being the installation directory
of libSBML.
